1. Bascially in this kind of array problem, that is to trace **one index** and others, you can use *extra* indicator (pointer, array) to help u record. 
   So here I use:  `vector<int> product_begin(n) vector<int> product_end(n);` 
   Now, the complexity: O(n) time and O(n) space 

2.	Optimization:
